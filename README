A simple Python script to take blogs written in Vim and turn them into a
format that looks desirable on Tumblr. Namely, the spacing is off if I simply
copy and paste my max-80-char-line vim blog entries right into Tumblr. What is
looks nice on Tumblr is not readable to me in Vim.

Effect:
Takes a file, say "blog_entry", formats it, and creates a new file called
"blog_entry.tumblr". This can then be copied directly into a Tumblr textarea.

ASSUMES:
- The top two lines are used for a title and a newline.
- Bullets use '-', '+', or '*'

Future additions:
- A script that reverses this process. I should be able to make an edit in
  Tumblr and change my local files accordingly without directly modifying the
original.
